🛡️ Phishing Simulation & Security Awareness Demo

This project is a self-contained, safe, and non-malicious phishing simulation environment designed for training and demonstration purposes.


It runs entirely inside a single HTML file, with:

✔ Simulated phishing email lure
✔ Simulated landing page
✔ Dummy credential submission
✔ Click logs and awareness reporting
✔ No backend, no data collection, 100% safe


🧠 Why This Project?

Security awareness teams need a demo-friendly environment to show:

How phishing works

How landing pages trick users

How logs & metrics are generated

How training reports are created

This project provides a contained educational simulation without sending any real emails or capturing real data.



🚀 Features

Single self-contained HTML project

Interactive phishing workflow

Logs: Click Events, Credential Attempts

Awareness Metrics Panel

No external dependencies

No backend, no server

Safe for training & presentations
